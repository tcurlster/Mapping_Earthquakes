# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Overview

This project incorporates the use of Leaflet and Mapbox with Javascript to display earthquakes and tectonic plates data from GeoJSON files.

The sites of earthquakes are denoted with circle markers that are larger and differentiating colors based on the magnitude of the earthquake.  I've also included a tectonic plate toggle within the map controls so the user can see how the  location of an earthquake compares to the intersection of tectonic plates.

The 3 different map views allows the user to select a view that makes the earthquakes standout better against a particular background.
